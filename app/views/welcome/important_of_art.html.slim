			| Nowadays there is a broad number of independent artists within our community that have troubles to sell or even to display their masterpieces to people interested in art. This problemâ€™s origin is in the culture that we have. In our society, specially in Monterrey, we have a lack of culture and interest in art therefore art can be displayed in a limited number of places and these places are not always open to everyone. We consider that a webpage dedicated to independent artists can allow them to expand their market and scope. This can also help make Monterrey a place with more culture.

			|We want to be the definitive link between artists and art collectors in Mexico, providing a service that satisfies both parties needs, all this in order to promote culture and art within the city and therefore have a greater cultural heritage.
